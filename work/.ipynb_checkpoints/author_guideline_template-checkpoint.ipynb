    "This article introduces Design Based History Research (DBHR) as a methodological bridge between the practices of digital-history tool design, the use of digital methods to create historical argumentation, and social-science-inspired methodological innovation. Design Based Research (DBR) is an educational-research approach to studying learning theory that integrates theoretically motivated user interface features, user activities, and data-structure choices into an initial tool/software-package design and then uses case studies of the design package as a way of iteratively reifying the theoretical principles in each of the tool's design phases. DBHR is an adaptation of the DBR approach, with a theoretical approach grounded in the unique needs of historians and historiographic practices.\n",

    "We aim to illustrate DBHR by describing the design and use of Net.Create, a user-focused network-analysis tool that prioritizes historiographic practices (evidence interpretation, citation preservation, and historiographic debate) in its feature development and user-interface choices. We document how the needs of digital historians shaped the current design of Net.Create, explore the connections between specific tool features and their operation, and delineate how those tool features support the digital-history needs we identified. As part of this iterative-design process, we will also address some of the human-computer-interaction analysis and user-entered network data that shaped each stage of our feature development around digital history practices.\n",

    "Our DBHR process ultimately led us to prioritize the development of three features that support and encourage sustained historiographic debate at each phase of a network-analysis digital-history project:\n",
    "- simultaneous entry of *capta*, data that is gathered and contested rather than downloaded or received, in order to support and encourage historiographic debate during the data-gathering phase and prior to a formal analysis phase\n",
    "- easy-to-use revision of network taxonomy and network data, to support interpretation, reinterpretation and re-input of evidence and data by many collaborators simultaneously, synchronously or asynchronously, during the initial analysis phase\n",
    "- data provenance features that expose the researchers' positionality and preserve the original citations for each network datapoint, to support the integration of close-reading analytical practices both by the research team and by other historians after the communication of results to a public audience\n",
    "\n",
    "By documenting the historiographic roots of each of these features, we hope to offer a systematic articulation of digital history tool design not simply as software development but as a pathway to the concurrent and intertwined development of historical theory, digital-history tools, and collaborative historical methods."

When historians import historical documents into digital tools for analysis, we are putting our documents back into boxes; \"computational black boxes\" to be exact. Bruno Latour describes computational black boxes, roughly, as clusters of complex systems that are too complex to fully describe. Instead, we put boundaries around the complexity we can't handle. We feed in data, export results, and forget or ignore the algorithmic processes inside the box. Every search field we encounter leads to its own black box, its results freely available but its logic obscured, as ChatGPT taught us in 2023."

The work of a microhistorian is shaped by the scale of the research, while public historians begin their work with questions of audience. Cultural and social historians differentiate their subfield methods by asking different questions and emphasizing the use of divergent types of documentary evidence to answer those questions. Digital historians generally blend digital history with another historical approach like social or cultural history. When digital historians engage in their analysis of a question generated by scale, scope, audience, or sourcing using a tool built by practitioners in another discipline, we inherit the research priorities of the people who built that tool. As a consequence, when there are methods sections in digital-history articles, those sections tend focus on how a tool developed by non-historians might support, or need to be adapted for, particular historical questions.

Researchers seeking to understand how people learn use DBR by integrating a motivating educational theory into a tool and/or activity design, implementing their design, and then studying the learning outcomes from that design as a way of modifying both their motivating theory and the design that aims to reify the theory. The educational researchers making use of DBR stress its value in providing a way to assess the application of theory  through the development and design principles that guide, inform, and improve theory, practice, and research in educational contexts. As they are laid out below, the applicable principles of DBR, describe a relationship between the theory-driven development of a software design with its accompanying activities, the testing of that design in iterative stages that provide use-case scenarios for the revision of the thoery and the design in tandem, and the application of those revised theoretical principles with their practical design outcomes in other people's research and practice.<cite data-cite=\"32868/EMN6PG6E\"></cite>"

    "Adapting DBR to DBHR starts with the acknowledgement that the article \"the\" in \"the historical method\" isn't a monolith. The historical method governs not a singular approach to history--a single, well-articulated, unified \"the\"--but a wide variety of praxis, theory, and individual approaches to the study of the past that puts archival source material in conversation with other historical experts. Questions of scale, audience, sourcing, and presentation all shape these conversations, whether we put those questions in a methods section or not. The work of a microhistorian is shaped by the scale of the research, while public historians begin their work with questions of audience. Cultural and social historians differentiate their subfield methods by asking different questions and emphasizing the use of divergent types of documentary evidence to answer those questions. Public historians have developed methods to evaluate format, audience movement and public interaction as part of exhibit design for both in-person and digital public-history exhibits.<cite data-cite=\"32868/ADV4GAQV\"></cite> In our teaching, historians communicate a reasonably well-developed description of each of these methdologies, which aligns our field with the social-science approach that says defined methods should be included in published scholarship.<cite data-cite=\"32868/Z2USYDSR\"></cite>"

    "The governing principle of DBHR is that a concrete set of design choices rooted in historiographic principles can be iterated, tested, and redesigned to create a digital tool that doesn't just support, but encourages and furthers, historical analysis for users with a variety of historical experience. To illustrate that process, we now proceed to outline a series of design choices made over the course of 5 years during the development of Net.Create. As part of that exploration, it's worth outlining the basic principles of network analysis before then moving to the historiographic principles on which Net.Create's development was based. The first thing people notice when they view a network visualization for the first time are the circles and lines. Those circles are nodes--people, places, things--or the nouns in a network. Edges, or lines, represent an interaction between two nodes, creating a node-edge pair or dyad. Each dyad, in turn, aggregates to form a network comprised of many interactions; nodes that have the most interactions, or degrees, are represented as larger circles with a higher measure of degree centrality."

    "Digital historians have offered many ways to understand historical significance through the lens of network analysis. CITE The simplest approach to historical argumentation through networks suggests that these high-degree-central nodes represented as large circles, are historically significant because they appear regularly in primary sources. CITE Below, for instance, we can see the nodes and edges that represent one version of the connections between members of the Julio-Claudian court describied in Tacitus' Annals, a second-century history of the late Roman Empire.<cite data-cite=\"32868/LWIUPFXH\"></cite> In this version of Tacitus' network, which was built by students in a process we'll address in section XXXX, the two largest nodes are labeled \"Claudius\" and \"Agrippina\". Emperor Claudius has 44 edges that link him to other nodes, for a degree-centrality measurement of 44; his fourth wife Agrippina's is 43, so the two nodes are similarly weighted in, or demonstrate a significant role in the historical events represented by, this network."

    "The aggregation of many node-edge pairs also allows historians to identify different kinds of significance.

We4 power brokers who form points of connection between factions in a network.<cite data-cite=\"32868/KWEIABPM\"></cite><cite data-cite=\"32868/G6AXUCDT\"></cite><cite data-cite=\"32868/5NB67TI3\"></cite> For instance, in the network below, Octavia has a degree-centrality measure of 7, a much lower degree-centrality measure than either Claudius or Agrippina, but she is a connector between several very high-degree nodes, including Claudius and Agrippina; her betweenness-centrality meausure--that is, her connection to significant historical actors whose role in the historical events of the Julio-Claudian dynasty is very visible--is high even if her degree-centrality measure is not."

    "Most network software packages in regular use by digital historians (Gephi<cite data-cite=\"32868/9IXJ2T2G\"></cite>, Cytoscape<cite data-cite=\"32868/EASDXMTU\"></cite>, Palladio<cite data-cite=\"32868/6KKNEIDS\"></cite>, to name a few) can support centrality measures and other statistically driven network measures. These software packages can divide a network into smaller subnetworks, or identify the shortest path between two actors in the network to analyze the spread of information in a network. Network analysis tools built for and by data and computer scientists are designed precisely to address these sorts of questions about centrality and affinity, particularly for networks at scale, such as the big-data networks that place individual social media interactions in a global-internet context. At the same time, the features and data requirements of other network-analysis software packages can be barriers to the practices necessary to support, much less encourage, historical-data practices. In particular, many network datasets are downloaded; they are *data* that is given, in the true definition of data, to a research team with pre-formulated categories for the actors in a network and rigid, predefined relationships between those actors.<cite data-cite=\"32868/5MZTR87M\"></cite> By contrast, historians work with *capta*<cite data-cite=\"32868/KDHLEAN5\"></cite>, or \"artisanal\" information captured and transformed via the interpretive process. Some historical network capta is hand-gathered, annotated, and transformed using custom taxonomy (categories for nodes, edges, and attributes or notes that accompany the node-edge pair information); other historical network data can be downloaded, but it is rarely organized in a taxonomy appropriate to the historical analysis at hand and needs to be annotated and transformed via the same interpretive processes that govern hand-gathered capta."

    "We first encountered these barriers in a classroom encounter with historical network analysis. One of our team wanted to use network analysis to help students identify, and trace the interactions between, historical agents from a complex historical source but found it impossible to build a coherent network dataset from scratch in a classroom with 75 students working on that dataset simultaneously. There were too many different ways to reference  historical actors and too few large-scale-data-management tools available to us. The simple, partial solutions we crafted to solve that issue were immediately salient to one of those instructor's network-analysis research projects, which involved collaboratively building a network of historical interactions from archival sources from scratch. This experience inspired a series of conversations that anchored those early, related, classroom and research experiences in a larger-scale design process."

    "Over the course of a multi-year DBHR redesign-and-revision process--a process outlined in brief in tables XXXX and XXXX and fully articulated in the sections that follow--our team of historical and network-analysis methods experts and tool designers, in cooperation with our users, identified a number of gaps in existing network analysis software packages that have implications for historians using network analysis. First, many network analysis packages require researchers to establish a fairly rigid node and edge taxonomy in advance. That is, researchers need to determine the types of nodes and edges that will be collected from a network-data source and define how different node types will connect to each other before beginning to enter data. This requirement means that network-analysis software packages often cannot accommodate developing understanding of relationships. Second, many network analysis packages are designed for self-contained datasets and as a result, don't automatically accommodate citations at the individual-data-point level. Optional attribute fields can be added, but the optional nature of those attributes means that citations are often overlooked at the individual node-and-edge level. Third, network analysis software packages are primarily designed for individual researchers working with large-scale scraped or pre-prepped datasets, not for historians drawing structured network data through interpretive processes from unstructured sources with colleagues. Johanna Drucker calls this process of gathering, debating, and shaping humanities data *capta*. Because the labor-intensive nature of *capta* is often collaborative and conversational, there's an unfilled need for research teams to simultaneously enter and respond to points of information being provided by other researchers."

    "In our first attempt to establish, and then prioritize, a list of features that would reshape practices of network analysis around principles of the historical method, we identified flexible taxonomy and a clear citation requirement for each network data point drawn from a historical source. As we explored why these two features were so important for historians using network analysis, our inquiry process around the took highlighted several other data features and network-visualization features that we felt were missing or not fully developed, from the perspective of the historical method, in other network analysis software packages. In Table XXXX, we list three design needs we identified by considering historiographic principles, each of which has several user-interface design choices associated with it in Net.Create. The different user-interface and data-structure elements that support these three design needs were added at various points in the tool design process. Some were driven by the research team's initial scan of network-analysis software package features that served historiographic principles less well, while others were driven by the research team's observation of how novice historians interacted with the network graphs and data tables and how they connected the network data/graph to the original sources as they crafted historical arguments."

    "Our design goal for Net.Create was not to create yet another fully-functional network analysis package. Rather, we aimed build a tool that would focus on a few key features, drawing on the presentation and input of network data and on centrality measures in network analysis practices to foster moments of historical analysis (both in terms of historical-network-analysis and traditional historical analysis) that might otherwise not have happened. We sought to identify how we might reshape the tools that govern network-analysis experiences to better support historians, initially based on our own classroom and research experiences and then iteratively with a variety of historians working on network-analysis projects of varying levels, by crafting crafted a multi-disciplinary team of network analysts, historians, and educational researchers. That set of participants allowed us to better understand how people learn, how historians work with networks, and how network best practices function to support many kinds of analysis. We then expanded our work to engage with entry-level historians in history clasrooms to explore the potental history-learning moments that network analysis offered, and to see which sorts of history and network analysis best supported each other. Finally, we worked with practicing historians with entry-level network analysis skill to align our understanding of those learning processes across several historical-methods and network analysis skill levels."

    "We did not identify all of these needs, or the features we developed to meet these needs, at once, or at the beginning of the Net.Create project, which points to an additional benefit of DBHR as a digital-history: its long-term value as a way to build expertise across interdisciplinary teams. DBHR offered an ongoing assessment process that accommodates, and responds to, both designer and user needs and builds expertise both in the tool design itself and in the methods that scaffold tool usage. In each of 6 stages of redesign, we addressed either a user-interface or data choice within the Net.Create tool or the specific instructions we used to scaffold use of the Net.Create tool by teams of historians. We then analyzed the resulting behaviors and datasets in order to establish a concrete list of current barriers to the historical method in existing network-analysis user interfaces, explore the possible user-interface or user-activity design principles that would reshape network analysis practices around the hisitorical method, and then enacted those design principles in case studies with practicing historians of all levels."

    "Our first exploration into network tool design was in data entry. We briefly noted earlier that the first official stage of our network-analysis DBHR process started in a classroom. Students in the third unit of a a semester-long course on social and cultural reactions to outbreaks of bubonic plague taught by Craig were studying an outbreak of bubonic plague in Honolulu, HI. *Plague and Fire* <cite data-cite=\\\"32868/IRAIZC6T\\\"></cite> contains a detailed account of a bubonic plague outbreak in Honolulu that began in late 1899, peaked in an out-of-control fire set by a white-settler-dominated board of health in downtown Honolulu in early 1900, and resulted in the quarantine and displacement of native Hawaiians, Chinese and Japanese immigrants in the year that followed. Students in previous version of the course struggled to identify and trace the interactions of the many figures involved in this outbreak and its aftermath. We hypothesized that students would be more readily able to explore historical significance in the monograph's narrative if they were given a visualization that showed historical agents interacting, they might be able to better understand who had agency in this plague outbreak, who didn't, and who was affected."

We leveraged activity theory to understand how learners in a classroom might understand these complex interactions. ACTIVITY THEORY PIECE HERE. Network analysis offered an ideal way to divide the contents of a large text like *Plague and Fire* among many students. Assigning a small excerpt from a large text, and asking students to take notes on their assigned excerpt, helped focus students on a small digestible portion of the reading. we first asked them to engage deeply with the contents of an excerpt, then place the information from their excerpt into the context of a co-created set of notes, and then visualize those notes as a network with its attendant centrality measures. We then used the process of *capta* to gather the building blocks of network analysis, transforming students' notes into node-edge pairs describing interactions drawn from the text."

    "In order for students to use the series of interactions they recorded, as either a set of classroom-generated notes or a network, we needed two things. First, we needed a central place to collect simple network data; each interaction would be comprised of a source node and a target node so that we could track people, groups, places and things as they interacted with each other. Each network data point--the source node, target node, and interaction edge--would also need to be justified with a citation that supported revision and debate about the inclusion and form of that network edge. We took a human-engineering, rather than a software-engineering route, to build this first network. We built a Google form with human-readable field names mapped to nodes, node types, edges, and citations. We then gave students a clear sense of the historical interactions they should attend to. The resulting spreadsheet (data table XXXX) offered the instructor a simple platform that could be cleaned, and eventually sorted by citation page number or network actor (Table XXXX)."

    "The cleaned dataset, in turn, was intended to allow the instructor to distribute the notes to students as a table-based reading guide and transform the data into a network using Gephi that would offer degree-centrality measures as a first step to assessing the students' co-constructed understanding of historical significance in *Plague and Fire*. The two features from this human-engineered network activity (Net.Create v0.01) that were most salient for rounds 2 and 3 of our design process were oriented toward disambiguation and change over time. Some historical figures were referred to in several different ways. This helped students engage with some of the complexities that can make it difficult to identify significant moments in a historical primary source, but the ambiguity was a barrier to simplifying the interactions in network itself. Our instructor manually cleaned the student data, but the experience helped us identify the need for a feature that supports programmatic disambiguation without collapsing the historical references to a single, historically inaccurate (or historically incomplete) label. The second issue had to do with historical context. Because students could not immediately see their peers' data in an easily sorted form--or see the network visualization with labels and notes concurrently with their data entry--they struggled to see how their excerpt fit into the historical context of the monograph independently without instructor support. Despite these limitations, the activity supported a very lively historiographic debate about what mattered in *Plague and Fire*."

     "abstract": "Gephi is an open source software for graph and network analysis. It uses a 3D render engine to display large networks in real-time and to speed up the exploration. A flexible and multi-task architecture brings new possibilities to work with complex data sets and produce valuable visual results. We present several key features of Gephi in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing, filtering, navigating, manipulating and clustering. Finally, by presenting dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key aspects of dynamic network visualization.",

     "abstract": "Since the popular emergence of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s, nothing has been clearer about the digital environment than that it changes at a breakneck pace, making it a constant challenge of adaptation for content providers. Public historians who may have come of age in the context of writing either concise wall labels for the public or extended scholarly articles and conference papers for their fellow historians might find the pace and the level of flexibility and interactivity of the Web disconcerting, but in the end, the advantages for the practice of public history are extensive. Breaking the constraints of a physical site by effectively using the Web leaves public historians constrained only by their time, resources, and imagination. This chapter deals specifically with the various modes of communication that are available to public historians through the use of new media.",

This article discusses how Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) can inform design-based research practices that focus on understanding activity in real-world situations. I provide a sample data set with activity systems analyses of a yearlong teacher professional development program designed to foster technology integration into rural Indiana schools. I present the analytical dilemmas I faced while maintaining trustworthiness in the qualitative data analysis. Through the sample data analysis, I demonstrate how the school-wide technology reform initiative affected and was affected by classroom-based teacher technology implementation projects. Additionally, I introduce the theoretical findings from the data analyses that contribute to further development in activity systems analysis.",
